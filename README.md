## [White Ticket Project Using Web3 & Smart Contract]

## About

_The White Ticket_ is a newly developed peer to peer ticketing platform based on _smart contract_. 

Once an agency releases concert tickets, users can buy them directly through our platform or trade them within the personal level. 

All the transactions are dealt with ethereum, with the smart ticket transmitted to the user through the application.

## Quick Start

   Installation requires [`Git`] and triggers [`git clone`] for each configured repository.
   
   And truffle and ganache are also needed to compile smart contract.
